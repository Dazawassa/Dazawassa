            <p id="id_width">I am Jacqueline, I also sometimes go by my unofficial middle name Zoey. I am a female software developer who has loved software development for a very long time!</p>
            <p id="id_width">My love for software development traces all the way back to around 2010, this was when I first installed the Halo Custom Edition Development Kit for my copy of Halo custom edition and
                began to play with the software, slowly I learned how to edit levels, build levels, spawn character and weapons; eventually I began to learn how to script events, with that being the events
                that sparked my long lasting interest for computer programming.
            </p>
            <p id="id_width">Eventually this leads onto me replaying Pokemon Red around 2014, at this time I was still doing all the stuff with Halo but I had withdrawn a large amount, at that point I was only running servers
                and wasn't really doing the modding side, this was mostly due to the restrictive nature of modifying Halo as it was first designed for the Original XBox and designed to not be modded.
                As I was replaying Pokemon Red I remember reading about it online and finding out about the focus energy glitch, simply put focus energy is glitches as it increases your chance of a critical hit to a value
                higher than what 8-bit containers can go to and thus counts backwards to the lowest number, meaning you wont ever hit a critical.</p>

                <p id="id_width">I then found the Mew glitch, to this day I feel that this is one of the most interesting and amazing technical exploits ever, it is very long to explain, due to the original gameboy having such small memory the developers would use the same container to hold different values at different given times,
                an example that is relevant to this glitch is that the container for the special stat of the opposing pokemon is the same container that is used to store random encounter data, by exploiting a glitch that forces the game
                into constantly thinking it is in the battle mode in order to block the game from changing the data in that container, and then forcing a random encounter will use the special stat as the id for what pokemon you will encounter.
            </p>
            <p id="id_width">The complexity, depth and planning involved with that was what got me interested in computers outside of just gaming, I picked up C++ as a hobby along with C and Java, I also began to study the behind the scene aspects of software and hardware.</p>
            <p id="id_width">I learned a lot about how the Windows operating system worked, I also learned a large amount of technical aspects behind video games, but primarily I became very interested on the software side of smaller scale electronics, things like security cameras and card readers, I also became interested in systems used for commerce, such as banking systems or ordering systems in shops.</p>
            <p id="id_width">And all of those events lead up to where I am now, I am attending college in order to eventually begin working with computers in the near future, I generally enjoy lower level languages, although I do have skills with others, specifics about this can be seen on my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio page</a> I also stil develop mods for video games, which can be found on this website but I don't tend to do that as much as I use to.</p>
            <p id="id_width">You can also find other projects I have done, such as work I have done for college, uni, and also personal projects, primarily software I have developed, along with it all being open source when possible as I am a massive freak for things being open source.</p>
            <p id="id_width">I do hope you enjoyed reading this, if so please explore around the website using the navigation bar above, as I am sure you will find things that you will enjoy if you liked the above!</p>
