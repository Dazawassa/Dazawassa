            <p>This site is a glorified CV, on here you can find all of my personal projects that I have developed under the portfolio tab, or more specifically mods I have made for video games under the mods tab.</p>
            <p>I would normally have that in the portfolio section but I know certain people will only be here for the mods so there we go. But if you are here for other reasons then that portfolio tab is probably where you want to look.</p>
            <p>Any software I develop I make open source whenever possible so anything in that tab will also have links to the github so you can view the source code of the software, if you are interested in other things about me, check the about me tab.</p>
            <p>This will just list relavent information about me, places I have worked, it is mostly a glorified CV that you can look at, there will also be an email address in the top bar if you want to contact me along with links to other relavent social media pages if anything here interests you. Thanks for reading!</p>
