            <p>I am Dazawassa. And this is my page for all the things I make and post online. I use to be a very online person with a heavy presence. Now I like to just do my own thing and keep out the public. But I still enjoy making things and trying to provide a positive experience for people.</p>
            <p>I guess as is obvious I like code. I've been writting since 2011 when I got into modding Halo. But I never properly began to apply my skills until entering higher education in 2019. Hence why my catalouge of original software is so limited. I am working on expanding it but developing these systems takes time.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy music and did lessons for vocals and guitar for 6 years. However recording music is expensive. So I probably won't be on that bandwagon until the coding takes off.</p>
            <p>Feel free to contact me if needed!</p>
