                <p>This is my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCieMWxvUEWdUYHyY78Yg-RQ">YouTube channel</a>, I use this to display footage of projects I have developed, I don't tend to upload on it often but I intend to change that by making more things to share on there.</p>

                <h1><a href="https://github.com/ToothpasteHair">GitHub:</a></h1>
                <p>What is put on my GitHub shouldn't surprise people, I upload Source Code onto there, usually from none gaming related things onto my GitHub so you won't find mods there or Unreal Engine projects, but anything else I make will be put up there, although only the source code.</p>

                <p>My DropBox is where you can find downloads for everything I make, If it isn't on my GitHub then it will be on here. I have attempted to organise the files in an easy to follow and clear way so you can find what you are looking for as quickly as possible.</p>
