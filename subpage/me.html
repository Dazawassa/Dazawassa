            <p>I am Jacqueline. I was born in 2003 and have a long lasting love for computers, for over 10 years now I have been developing software and doing other such things with the use of a computer.
                As a child I enjoyed playing Halo Combat Evolved, and after seeing people on YouTube develop mods for the video game I was inspired to do the same. Following I would download the modding tools and play around with creating custom scenarios in the game and playing with the scripting.
            </p>
            <p>Following that I am now not only able to develop mods for both Halo and other video games, but can develop software and do what I think is a very good job at it. Some tasks may be a struggle for me but I will still get though it, I see everything as a bigger picture, if I don't want to do it I still will as I know it will lead to something great in the end.</p>
            <p>One of my largest interests currently is mobile development, particularly with Android, I have always loved the freedom that the Android operating system offers; pair that with my love for Java and Android development is something the I enjoy greatly and would enjoy having a career in! On this site you can find Android apps I made in the projects section if interested as well.</p>
            <p>Software development isn't the only thing I do, I also love studying languages. I have skills in many languages, although I have a particular leaning towards Celtic languages such as Irish or Breton, firther down the page I will list languages I know along with multiple skills I have related to employment if anyone is curious about it.</p>
            <p>I have and still do run a Instagram page that preserves the Celtic languages and aims to teach my followers how to speak them, although I do not have a larger follower base, I do still have a loyal following who greatly enjoy what I do on there.</p>
            <p>Past experience I have had includes, working as a teaching assistant for a computer class in 2019. Information about everything listed can all be found on my LinkedIn page, which will be linked in my Social page along with ways you can contact me.</p>
